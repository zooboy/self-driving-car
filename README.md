# self-driving-car
This repository mainly for  the implemented projects of Udacity 'Self-Driving Car Engineer'.
#### 1. Finding_Lane_Lines_on_the_Road
Detecting the lane lines on the road , mainly for the strait lane lines.
#### 2. Traffic_Sign_Recognition
Building and Training a CNN model to recognize the traffic sign.
#### 3. Behavioral_Cloning
Building and Training a CNN model to generate the car's steer behavior.
#### 4. Advanced_Lane_Lines_Finding
Using open cv method to find and draw the curve lane lines.
#### 5. vehicle_detection
detecting the vehicles on highway by traditional computer vision and mechine learning methods.
#### 6. Extended-Kalman-Filter
Tracking  vehicle's (bicycle model) position and velocity by extended-kalman-filter with sensor fusion data from lidar and radar.
#### 7. Unscented-Kalman-Filter
Tracking  vehicle's (bicycle model) position and velocity by unscented-kalman-filter with sensor fusion data from lidar and radar.
#### 8. Particle-Filter
Using sensor and control data to Locate the vehicle 's position on global digital map by a particle-filter 
#### 9.PID-Control
Using a PID controller to control the vehicle driving along with a reference trajectory.
#### 10. MPC-Control
Using a MPC controller to control the vehicle driving along with a reference trajectory.
#### 11.path-planning
Designing a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic.
#### 12.Semantic-Segmentation
Labeling the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).
#### 13.System-Integration
Writing ROS nodes to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following

#### Note : Due to the limit of the number of files that uploading in one folder, I removed the 'Eigen' library from 'src' folder in these projects written by C++ .
