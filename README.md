# self-driving-car
This repository mainly for  the implemented projects of Udacity 'Self-Driving Car Engineer'.
#### 1. Finding_Lane_Lines_on_the_Road
Detecting the lane lines on the road , mainly for the strait lane lines 
#### 2. Traffic_Sign_Recognition
Building and Training a CNN model to recognize the traffic sign.
#### 3. Behavioral_Cloning
Building and Training a CNN model to generate the car's steer behavior.
#### 4. Advanced_Lane_Lines_Finding
Using open cv method to find and draw the curve lane lines 
#### 5. vehicle_detection
detecting the vehicles on highway by traditional computer vision and mechine learning methods 
#### 6. Extended-Kalman-Filter
Tracking  vehicle's (bicycle model) position and velocity by extended-kalman-filter with sensor fusion data from lidar and radar
#### 7. Unscented-Kalman-Filter
Tracking  vehicle's (bicycle model) position and velocity by unscented-kalman-filter with sensor fusion data from lidar and radar
#### Note : Due to the limit of the number of files that uploading in one folder, I removed the 'Eigen' library from 'src' folder in these projects written by C++ .
